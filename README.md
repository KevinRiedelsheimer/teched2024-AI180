# AI180 - Build your own Generative AI Scenario in a Snap

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2024 session called "AI180 - Build your own Generative AI Scenario in a Snap".

## Overview

This session introduces attendees to integrating orchestration capabilities of Generative AI Hub into their own scenarios using SAP Cloud SDK for AI (JavaScript) or SAP generative AI hub SDK (Python).
Accordingly this session offers two parallel tracks:

- [SAP Cloud SDK for AI (JavaScript)](<sap-cloud-sdk-for-ai-(javascript)>)
- [SAP generative AI hub SDK (Python)](<sap-generative-ai-hub-sdk-(python)>)

Both tracks cover identical core concepts and practical applications, differing only in the programming language and SDK utilized. Participants can choose the track that best aligns with their expertise or opt to experience both to broaden their understanding.

By the end of this session, attendees will have gained practical experience in leveraging these powerful SDKs to enhance their AI-driven solutions, regardless of their chosen programming environment. Join us to unlock the full potential of Generative AI in your projects and stay at the forefront of AI integration.
