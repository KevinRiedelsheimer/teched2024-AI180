# AI180 - Build your own Generative AI Scenario in a Snap

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2024 session called "AI180 - Build your own Generative AI Scenario in a Snap".

## Overview

This session introduces attendees to integrating orchestration capabilities of Generative AI Hub into their own scenarios using SAP Cloud SDK for AI (JavaScript) or SAP generative AI hub SDK (Python).
Accordingly, this session offers two parallel tracks:

- [SAP Cloud SDK for AI (JavaScript)](./exercises/javascript/README.md)
- [SAP generative AI hub SDK (Python)](./exercises/python/README.md)

Both tracks cover identical core concepts and practical applications, differing only in the programming language and SDK utilized. Participants can choose the track that best aligns with their expertise or opt to experience both to broaden their understanding.

By the end of this session, attendees will have gained practical experience in leveraging these powerful SDKs to enhance their AI-driven solutions, regardless of their chosen programming environment. Join us to unlock the full potential of Generative AI in your projects and stay at the forefront of AI integration.

> 1. **System Duration**: The test system will be disabled at 17:00 CEST on Wed, Oct 16.
> 1. **Token and Rate Limits**: Each LLM has an input and output token limit of 1000, and a global rate limit applies per minute.
> 1. **Testing Purposes Only**: The test system is intended solely for testing purposes and not for any productive or commercial use.
> 1. The test system is offered for testing purposes, instead of any productive usage.
> 2. **Malicious Usage**: Any detection of malicious usage will result in immediate termination of your test system. Depending on the severity of the abuse, legal action may be pursued. An example of malicious behavior includes repeatedly hitting the rate limit every minute, for more than 8 hours a day.
