# AI180 - Build your own Generative AI Scenario in a Snap

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2024 session called "AI180 - Build your own Generative AI Scenario in a Snap".

## Overview

This session introduces attendees to integrating orchestration capabilities of Generative AI Hub into their own scenarios using SAP Cloud SDK for AI (JavaScript) or SAP generative AI hub SDK (Python).
Accordingly, this session offers two parallel tracks:

- [SAP Cloud SDK for AI (JavaScript)](./exercises/javascript/README.md)
- [SAP generative AI hub SDK (Python)](./exercises/python/README.md)

Both tracks cover identical core concepts and practical applications, differing only in the programming language and SDK utilized. Participants can choose the track that best aligns with their expertise or opt to experience both to broaden their understanding.

By the end of this session, attendees will have gained practical experience in leveraging these powerful SDKs to enhance their AI-driven solutions, regardless of their chosen programming environment. Join us to unlock the full potential of Generative AI in your projects and stay at the forefront of AI integration.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> As a Jump Start session, we can only offer free test systems to limited number of participants. 
> To get your test system, you have to follow our processes for sending a request. 
> The First-Come-First-Served rule is applied, and only the first **100** participants will get their individual test systems.
> We will maintain a waiting list for the rest of people.

> [!WARNING]
> ## Disclaimer
> 
> Please apply for the test systems, only if you accept the following statements:
> 1. Please only send **one request** for your own.
> 1. Requesting a test system on behalf of others is **prohibited**.
> 1. You understand, you might **NOT** get a test system, if you are not part of the first 100 participants.
> 1. You will receive the system details via email within **24 hours**.
> 1. The test system will be **disabled** at 17:00 CEST on Oct 16 (Wed).
> 1. Both input and output **token limit** of LLMs are set to 1000.
> 1. A global rate limit is applied for every minute.
> 1. The test system is offered for testing purposes, instead of any productive usage.
> 1. When detecting **malicious usage**, we will inform you, **terminate** the test system immediately and depending on the severity, SAP has the right to pursue a lawsuit. A typical example of malicious usage is to reach the rate limit every minute, every hour and more than 8 hours per day.
> 1. We only offer two models: `gemini-1.5-flash` and `meta--llama3-70b-instruct`.
