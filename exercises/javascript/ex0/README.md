Run the following to start the app locally:
```shell
npm run local

### 4. Verify the Application is Running:
After a few seconds, you should see the following log message:
```
Server running at http://localhost:8080

### 5. Access the Application:
Open your browser and visit http://localhost:8080/. You should see the message:
```
Hello World! üåç
